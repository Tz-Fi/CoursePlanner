# Curriculum Schedule Builder
ConU Hacks Winter 2017

### Project Goals

A website for helping to design your curriculum schedule.  The 3 main features are:
* Click on a course in the schedule to get all relevant information about that course, such as:
    * which semesters it can be taken (fall/winter/summer)
    * which other courses are prereqs/coreqs
    * any other useful information for curriculum scheduling
* After moving a course to another semester, automatically detect if the schedule is valid and if invalid inform the user why
* Export the completed schedule to pdf and download it
